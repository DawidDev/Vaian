# VAIAN

**Demo: [Vaian - your's movies](https://dawiddev.github.io/vaian/)** <br/>
If you want try to login in this app you should use _login_: **user** and _password_: **user**

The application was built with:

- React (react-router-dom)
- JavaScript
- HTML and CSS

The project was modeled on Netflix and Hbo Go. <br/>
The purpose of designing the website was to create a project for my Front-End Developer portfolio. It is only the front part. The database was simulated in the easiest and fastest way for me. Of course, you can connect a real database. Meanwhile, I just wanted to show you the possibilities of using react-router-dom.
